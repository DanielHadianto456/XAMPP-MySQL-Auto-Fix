You can use this tool to fix it

**Steps**
1. Locate your mysql directory within your XAMPP Folder.
Example directory: C:\xampp\mysql
2. **DO A MANUAL BACKUP OF YOUR mysql FOLDER FIRST HAND TO AVOID FILE LOSS JUST IN CASE**
3. Put the fix tool within the mysql folder you had just located
4. Make sure that you still have "data" folder within it
5. Run the tool
6. If there's a windows pop up telling you not to run it, choose "more info" then "run anyway"
7. And done, your mysql service is fixed

**NOTE**
1. **IF YOUR MYSQL SERVICE STILL DOESN'T WORK AFTER USING THE FIX, TRY RUNNING IT AGAIN FOR 2 OR 3 TIMES BEFORE RE-USING THIS FIX**
